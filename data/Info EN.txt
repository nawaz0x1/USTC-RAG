Background
University of Science and Technology Chittagong (USTC) was established as a Private University soon after Private University Act 1992 came into force when IAHS became its constituent body under Faculty of Medicine. The Janasheba Foundation has been its sponsoring organization and National Professor Dr. Nurul Islam was appointed the Vice Chancellor of USTC by Honorable Chancellor of the Universities and President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (PRB). Since then USTC started functioning with two Faculties, namely, Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Basic Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences. MBBS and BPharm (Hons) Programs are offered by these two Faculties. These two Faculties have been doing more than expectation and it is a matter of pride that Faculty of Medicine has a large number of foreign students today. Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology has opened up a new horizon for the Technological community of the country by launching a new Faculty entitled Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology (FSET)' in 1999 which is indeed another bold step by USTC in fulfilling its mission of expansion of higher education through private initiative. FSET had been started with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering since 1999 and now, this faculty constitutes with three (03) departments named as Computer Science & Engineering (CSE), Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE) and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering (ETE).

19) URC
Introduction (Preamble)
To fulfill the desire and firm willingness of the Honorable Founder Vice-Chancellor, USTC and National Professor Dr. Nurul Islam, USTC authorities have taken initiative to establish USTC Research Center (URC) at USTC in memory of Late FVC with an aim and objective to engage the scholars in researches that extend/go beyond the classroom and around the globe. In this respect, the Chairman, and Board of Trustees sanctioned a grant of Tk. 5-crore (50 million) with the approval of the Finance Committee, USTC for taking appropriate steps to accelerate the process. USTC, a private university outside Dhaka, has been functioning in Chittagong since 1992.

This university has opened up a new horizon under the leadership of FVC for the quality of Medical, Biological, Social Sciences, Engineering, Business, and other modern technology-oriented education in the country. The key goal of the institute is to provide a creative atmosphere in which higher studies and research thrive amongst the faculty and students’ need relevant to research in the advancement of the university which will match also with the vision of USTC. The purpose will be to build upon the established strengths of the USTC in key research areas in various faculties/departments of the institution. The URC will also improve and realize the research potentials of the teachers and students of USTC by providing adequate financial and technical support.

Activities
A major challenge with respect to research is securing the essential inputs both funding and research talent
To conduct effective, relevant, and ‘State of Art’ teaching for the faculties to enhance the basic skill of research
Keeping provision to send the faculties home/abroad for further training in serious aspects of Research Methodology
Forming a Research group in each faculty to share and update the advancement of recent research activities among the faculties and students too
To make blending the teaching, training & Research of the various faculties
Seminar
Learning is greatly enhanced by bringing theoretical knowledge and application together. In order to improve the understanding of practical issues of our students and faculties, interactive seminars will be organized. The arrangement of training/workshop on different areas of research methodology including ongoing curriculum implementation and its constraints, evaluation, and other fields (Education pedagogy of Medicine and other faculties).
Overcome The Challenges
In addition to USTC each faculty may publish at least one or two journals yearly
Journal club should be forwarded to accelerate the publication of Journal or Newsletter
The journal should be peer-reviewed and materials should be fundamental and applied
